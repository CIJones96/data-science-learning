- Uses statistics, programming, and domain knowledge

**Key Components**
- **Data:** Raw information (structured or unstructured)
- **Analysis:** Finding patterns and trends
- **Insights:** Actionable conclusions

**The Process:**
1. Ask the right questions
2. Collect relevant data
3. Clean and prepare data
4. Analyze and model
5. Communicate findings

### What Data Scientists Do

**Main Responsibilities:**

## Module 2: Data Science Topics

### The Data Science Methodology

**Framework:** CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)

**Six Phases:**

**1. Business Understanding**
- What problem are we solving?
- What questions need answers?
- Define success criteria

**2. Data Understanding**
- What data is available?
- Is the data sufficient?
- Initial exploration

**3. Data Preparation**
- Clean the data
- Handle missing values
- Feature engineering
- Most time-consuming phase (70-80%)

**4. Modeling**
- Select appropriate algorithms
- Train models
- Tune parameters

**5. Evaluation**
- Test model performance
- Does it meet business objectives?
- Validate results

**6. Deployment**
- Implement in production
- Monitor performance
- Maintain and update

**Key Point:** This is an iterative cycle, not linear

### Types of Analysis

**Descriptive Analysis:**
- What happened?
- Summarize historical data
- Example: Last quarter's sales figures

**Diagnostic Analysis:**
- Why did it happen?
- Identify causes and correlations
- Example: Why did sales drop in March?

**Predictive Analysis:**
- What will happen?
- Forecast future outcomes
- Example: Next quarter's sales prediction

**Prescriptive Analysis:**
- What should we do?
- Recommend actions
- Example: How to increase sales

### Machine Learning Basics

**Supervised Learning:**
- Learning from labeled data
- Has input and known output
- Types:
  - Classification (categories)
  - Regression (continuous values)

**Unsupervised Learning:**
- Learning from unlabeled data
- Find hidden patterns
- Types:
  - Clustering (grouping)
  - Dimensionality reduction

**Deep Learning:**
- Neural networks with multiple layers
- Used for complex patterns
- Examples: Image recognition, NLP

### Essential Tools Overview

**Programming Languages:**
- Python (most popular)
- R (statistics-focused)
- SQL (databases)

**Libraries:**
- pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical computing)
- matplotlib (visualization)
- scikit-learn (machine learning)

**Platforms:**
- Jupyter Notebooks (interactive coding)
- GitHub (version control)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud)
