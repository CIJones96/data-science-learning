## Module 2: Data Science Topics

### Big Data and Data Mining
- **Big Data:** Extremely large datasets that traditional tools can't handle
- **Data Mining:** Extracting patterns from large datasets
- Characteristics: Volume, Velocity, Variety (3 Vs)

### Big Data Processing Tools
- **Hadoop:** Distributed storage and processing framework
- **HDFS:** Hadoop Distributed File System (stores big data)
- **Hive:** Query language for Hadoop (SQL-like)
- **Spark:** Fast, in-memory processing (faster than Hadoop)

### AI and Data Science
- AI uses data science techniques
- Machine learning is subset of AI
- Data science enables AI applications

### Gen AI
- Generative AI (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.)
- Creates new content (text, images, code)
- Built on data science foundations

### Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- **Neural Networks:** Algorithms inspired by human brain
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks with many layers
- Used for: image recognition, NLP, complex patterns

### Regression
- Predicting continuous values
- Example: Predicting house prices, stock prices
- Foundation of many ML models
