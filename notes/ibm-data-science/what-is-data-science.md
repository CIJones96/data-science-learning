# Course 1: What is Data Science?

## Module 1: Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do

### What is Data Science?

**Definition**
- The field of exploring, manipulating, and analysing data
- Extracting insights to answer questions or solve problems
- Uses statistics, programming, and domain knowledge

**Key Components**
- **Data:** Raw information (structured or unstructured)
- **Analysis:** Finding patterns and trends
- **Insights:** Actionable conclusions

**The Process:**
1. Ask the right questions
2. Collect relevant data
3. Clean and prepare data
4. Analyze and model
5. Communicate findings

### What Data Scientists Do

**Main Responsibilities:**
- Collect and clean data
- Explore data to find patterns
- Build predictive models
- Communicate results to stakeholders
- Make data-driven recommendations

**Daily Tasks:**
- Writing code (Python, SQL)
- Data cleaning (70-80% of time)
- Building and testing models
- Creating visualizations
- Presenting findings

**Skills Required:**
- Programming (Python, R, SQL)
- Statistics and mathematics
- Machine learning
- Data visualization
- Communication and storytelling
- Domain knowledge (finance, healthcare, etc.)

### Types of Data

**Structured Data:**
- Organized in tables (rows and columns)
- Examples: Spreadsheets, databases
- Easy to query with SQL

**Unstructured Data:**
- No predefined format
- Examples: Text, images, videos, social media
- Requires special processing
- 80-90% of all data is unstructured

### Key Roles in Data

**Data Analyst:**
- Focus: Descriptive analysis, reporting
- Tools: SQL, Excel, Tableau
- Output: Dashboards, reports

**Data Scientist:**
- Focus: Predictive modeling, insights
- Tools: Python, R, ML algorithms
- Output: Models, predictions

**Data Engineer:**
- Focus: Building data infrastructure
- Tools: SQL, Spark, cloud platforms
- Output: Data pipelines, warehouses

**Machine Learning Engineer:**
- Focus: Deploying ML models to production
- Tools: Python, TensorFlow, cloud services
- Output: Scalable ML systems
