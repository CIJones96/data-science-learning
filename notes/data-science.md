    Big Data has 5 characteristics: Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value
    The 5 cloud computing characteristics are: On-Demand, Self-Service, Broad Network Access, Resource Pooling, Rapid Elasticity, and Measured Service
    Data Mining has a 6 step process: Goal Setting, Selecting Data Sources, Pre-Processing, Transforming, Mining, and Evaluation
    Deep Learning uses neural networks to teach itself patterns in inputs and outputs.
    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to learn about data and make predictions without programming the analysis methods into the system.
    Regression identifies the strenth and amount of the correlation between one or more inputs and an output.
    Gen AI is a subset of AI which focuses on producing new data rather than just analysing existing data. It allows machines to create content like images, music, computer code etc.
